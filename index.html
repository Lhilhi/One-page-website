  <p>Is a statement not a style.Fashion does not have to be worn Casually nor outside the run away. Fashion fit all sizes for all people of all ages.Fashion is an art of Personal Self-Expression,not an excuse to be Preety or Popular. Style is expressing yourself through what you wear. Licensed from iStockPhoto. noun. Style is defined as a particular of doing or saying something, or refers to a unique form of clothing or way of arranging your appearance. An example of style is the method by which you learn. Fashion is a popular style, especially in clothing, footwear, lifestyle products, accessories, makeup, hairstyle and body. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. Fashion plays an increasingly important role in an indivi­dual’s life because it is considered as a means of self-expression. The garments and accessories that man or women wear, help them to identify with a group of others-whether it is a lifestyle, profession, a religion, or an attitude. Thus, the term ‘fashion’ has become synonymous with the overall growth of the country as well. Every person nurtures an innate desire of looking good and feel ‘accepted’ in the socio-economic circle. The word fashion instantaneously brings to mind a flash of colour with a dash of glamour.Women are taking to fashion in a big way, and are experimenting with different looks, styles, and textures.  Today, fashion does not necessarily mean glamour, or the urge to follow the current trends. It is more a way of life, a reflection of inner beauty, where the intellect shines through, complete with comfort quotient. Fashion not only highlights the social history and the needs of person but also the overall cultural aesthetic of the various periods. The evolution of fashion dates back to several hundred years and as our attitude and culture change, fashion comes along with it.</p>
